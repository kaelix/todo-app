  # Summary
  
  A project I made to learn JavaScript to build not only technical skills but also build my knowledge on software development to help push me towards my 
  goal of becoming a professional full stack software developer. Although challenging, the challenges faced in this project moved me closer to my goal 
  and gave me new skills to put towards future projects.
